> **Note:** This documentation is continuously updated to reflect the latest industry standards and best practices.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive material specifications
- Detailed manufacturing guidelines
- Thermal analysis tools
- Quality control procedures
- Assembly recommendations

## Getting Started

To begin working with Aeromat resources:

1. Review the material specifications
2. Understand thermal considerations
3. Follow machining guidelines
4. Implement quality control measures

```python
# Example of thermal analysis calculation
def calculate_thermal_expansion(length, coefficient, temp_change):
    """
    Calculate linear thermal expansion
    
    Args:
        length (float): Original length in meters
        coefficient (float): Coefficient of thermal expansion (1/°C)
        temp_change (float): Temperature change in °C
        
    Returns:
        float: Change in length due to thermal expansion
    """
    return length * coefficient * temp_change
```
